\textbf{Github}


\section{Description}
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system. GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts for open source projects.\\

\section{Observations}
Github is a great tool for working on projects on large groups, it stores any changes made to the code we are working on and it can revert those changes if you make a mistake or if you want to check a previous version of the code.\\

There are 3 ways to use Github, one is by console, which is a bit hard to use, the other is by using the browser version, which is fast and easy to use, and lastly there's the GUI which is easy fairly easy to use and very intuitive.
 
\section{Conclusions}
We used Github for all of the projects we did on Programming Languages, and it worked really well. It's function to return to a previous version of the code helped a lot. It's very easy to learn how to use it and very helpful to avoid saving files from previous versions of a code. However we did have a problem when we modified the code and files too much from other users, but it's a minor problem compared to all the benefits we get for using this tool.
